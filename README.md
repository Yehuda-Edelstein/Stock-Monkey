### Description
Stock Monkey is a simple and easy-to-use site for checking current stock prices. Enter any ticker into the search form and recieve a live quote, up to the minute. A link to the live feed of that very stock is displayed at the bottom of the site upon searching, to use for real-time and auto-updated quotes. All of Stock Monkey's information comes from Finnhub's Stock API. Below the header, a navigation bar includes links to external sites regarding other financial inquiries. The purpose of Stock Monkey was to create a site where all stock quotes could be easily found without having to identify the string of characters (i.e., the ticker) referenced a tradeable security, and, furthermore, without having to specify one desired said security's price.
